If the WebSetup installer is executed on a machine with IIS7, the component "IIS 6 Management Compatibility" must be installed first.

Click on Start > Control Panel > Turn Windows features on or off > Roles. Right-click on Web Server (IIS) and click on Add Role Services.
Install the component "IIS 6 Management Compatibility" and all sub components.
